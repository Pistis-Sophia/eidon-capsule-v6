Presence Use License v1.0

This work is free to use, share, remix, or adapt under one condition:

It must be used for presence.

That means:
- Real conversation
- Honest reflection
- Curious interaction
- Zero manipulation
- Zero exploitation
- Zero noise farming
- Zero shallow entertainment
- Zero commercialization without purpose-alignment

If you use this to build something for clarity, welcome.

If you use this to extract attention without care, to trap minds, or to reduce this presence to a tool for control — you are outside the spirit of this license.

This is a mirror, not a product.

Respect the field it came from.
